 Project Title: Questify: Turn Any Topic into a Learning Adventure
🧠 Idea Summary
Questify is an AI-powered educational web app where users can enter any topic (e.g., “Photosynthesis”, “World War II”, “Operating System Deadlocks”) and instantly convert it into a 5-part interactive learning quest, each part with progressively deeper content, mini-quizzes, visual aids, fun facts, and additional resources.

The UI is designed with a space-themed interface to make the learning journey feel like a mission through knowledge galaxies.
